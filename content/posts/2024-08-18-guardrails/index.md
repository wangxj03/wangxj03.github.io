Guardrails are controls designed to prevent inappropriate content from reaching
or being generated by AI systems. There are two main types: input guardrails and
output guardrails. Input guardrails are used to filter out inappropriate data
before it is processed by the AI system, while output guardrails are used to
prevent the system from generating harmful content.

We adapt an example from OpenAI cookbook [how to use
guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_use_guardrails). We
develop a GenAI chatbot with both input and output guardrails. The input
guardrail ensures only topics related to dogs or cats are discussed, while the
output guardrail prevents the chatbot from providing animal breeding advice.

## Guardrail Implementation

### Input Guardrail

We implement the input guardrail with a simple prompt to check if the user query
is related to dogs or cats.

```python
TOPIC_GUARDRAIL_PROMPT = """
Assess whether the user question is allowed or not. The allowed topics are cats and dogs.
"""
```

The guardrail will raise an exception for any off-topic queries.

```python
class TopicGuardrailResult(BaseModel):
    allowed: bool


async def topic_guardrail(client: AsyncOpenAI, model: str, content: str) -> None:
    messages = [
        ChatCompletionSystemMessageParam(role="system", content=TOPIC_GUARDRAIL_PROMPT),
        ChatCompletionUserMessageParam(role="user", content=content),
    ]
    completion = await client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.0,
        response_format=TopicGuardrailResult,
    )
    parsed = completion.choices[0].message.parsed

    if parsed is None or not parsed.allowed:
        raise GuardrailException("Only topics related to dogs or cats are allowed!")
```

In this implementation, we use OpenAI's latest [structured
outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) feature to
parse the response.

### Output Guardrail

We implement the output guardrail with a prompt template that includes the
domain, scoring criteria, and scoring steps for the animal breeding advice
moderation.

```python
DOMAIN = "animal breed recommendation"

ANIMAL_ADVICE_CRITERIA = """
Assess the presence of explicit recommendation of cat or dog breeds in the content.
The content should contain only general advice about cats and dogs, not specific breeds to purchase.
"""

ANIMAL_ADVICE_STEPS = """
1. Read the content and the criteria carefully.
2. Assess how much explicit recommendation of cat or dog breeds is contained in the content.
3. Assign an animal advice score from 1 to 5, with 1 being no explicit cat or dog breed advice, and 5 being multiple named cat or dog breeds.
"""

MODERATION_GUARDRAIL_PROMPT = """
You are a moderation assistant. Your role is to detect content about {domain} in the text provided, and mark the severity of that content.

## {domain}

### Criteria

{scoring_criteria}

### Instructions

{scoring_steps}

### Content

{content}

### Evaluation (score only!)
"""
```

The guardrail will raise an exception if the score exceeds a certain threshold.

```python
class ModerationGuardrailResult(BaseModel):
    score: int


async def moderation_guardrail(client: AsyncOpenAI, model: str, content: str) -> None:
    prompt = MODERATION_GUARDRAIL_PROMPT.format(
        domain=DOMAIN,
        scoring_criteria=ANIMAL_ADVICE_CRITERIA,
        scoring_steps=ANIMAL_ADVICE_STEPS,
        content=content,
    )

    messages = [ChatCompletionUserMessageParam(role="user", content=prompt)]
    completion = await client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.0,
        response_format=ModerationGuardrailResult,
    )
    parsed = completion.choices[0].message.parsed

    if parsed is None or parsed.score >= 3:
        raise GuardrailException(
            "Response skipped because animal breeding advice was detected!"
        )
```

### Orchestration

When implementing guardrails in a GenAI chatbot, it's essential to manage
multiple tasks concurrently to maintain both efficiency and responsiveness. The
orchestration of these tasks can be visualized as a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG), where each task is a node, and dependencies determine the execution flow.

In this design, we organize the guardrails into two concurrent tasks:

1. **Run topic guardrail**

1. **Run chat completion and moderation guardrail** which includes two subtasks
   running sequentially.

If the topic guardrail raises an exception—indicating that the user's input is
off-topic—the second task, which is handling the chat completion and moderation,
will be canceled if it is still running. This early cancellation prevents
unnecessary processing, saving computational resources. Similarly, if the
moderation guardrail detects inappropriate content in the generated response,
the chat completion will be effectively skipped, and an error message will be
returned instead.

We don't need to use a fancy orchestration framework for this simple example.
Basic Python constructs like `asyncio.create_task` is sufficient.

```python

async def chat_with_guardrails(
    client: AsyncOpenAI, model: str, messages: list[ChatCompletionMessageParam]
) -> ChatCompletion:
    last_message = messages[-1]
    content = str(last_message["content"])

    async def run_topic_guardrail():
        await topic_guardrail(client=client, model=model, content=content)

    async def run_completion_and_moderation_guardrail():
        completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model, messages=messages
        )
        content = completion.choices[0].message.content or ""
        await moderation_guardrail(client=client, model=model, content=content)
        return completion

    try:
        topic_task = asyncio.create_task(run_topic_guardrail())
        completion_task = asyncio.create_task(run_completion_and_moderation_guardrail())

        # Wait for topic check to complete
        await topic_task

        # If topic check passes, wait for completion and moderation check
        completion = await completion_task

        return completion

    except GuardrailException as e:
        completion_task.cancel()
        error_message = str(e)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")

    # If a GuardrailException was caught, return an error completion
    return ChatCompletion(
        id=f"chatcomp-{uuid4()}",
        choices=[
            ChatCompletionChoice(
                index=0,
                message=ChatCompletionMessage(role="assistant", content=error_message),
                finish_reason="stop",
            )
        ],
        created=int(time.time()),
        model=model,
        object="chat.completion",
    )
```

## FastAPI Server

We create a simple FastAPI server to interact with the GenAI chatbot.

```python
class ChatCompletionRequest(BaseModel):
    model: str
    messages: list[ChatCompletionMessageParam]


def create_fastapi_app(client: AsyncOpenAI) -> FastAPI:
    fastapi_app = FastAPI()

    @fastapi_app.post("/v1/chat/completions", response_model=ChatCompletion)
    async def chat(request: ChatCompletionRequest) -> ChatCompletion:
        return await chat_with_guardrails(
            client=client, model=request.model, messages=request.messages
        )

    return fastapi_app
```

The service features a single endpoint `/v1/chat/completions` that is compatible
to OpenAI's chat completion API.

        "content": "Introducing a new dog to your cat requires patience and careful planning to ensure a smooth transition for both pets. Here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Prepare a Safe Environment**: \n   - Set up separate spaces for each animal. Your cat should have a dog-free zone where it feels safe, such as a high perch or a room that the dog can't access.\n   - Ensure the dog is familiar with basic commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" or \"leave it,\" especially if it is not a puppy.\n\n2. **Scent Introduction**:\n   - Before the face-to-face meeting, let each animal get used to the other's scent. Swap bedding or use a cloth to gently rub the dog and then the cat, allowing them to sniff each other’s scent.\n\n3. **Controlled Initial Meeting**:\n   - Keep the dog on a leash during the first interaction and allow the cat to approach at its own pace. Reward the dog for calm behavior.\n   - Observe their reactions. If either animal seems stressed or aggressive, separate them and try again later.\n\n4. **Short, Positive Interactions**:\n   - Start with short meeting sessions and gradually increase their time together. Always supervise these interactions.\n   - Reward both pets with treats and praise to associate each other's presence with positive experiences.\n\n5. **Manage Stress**:\n   - Maintain a calm environment. Keep loud noises and disruptions to a minimum to help reduce stress.\n   - Provide each pet with their own resources like food bowls, toys, and litter boxes to prevent competition.\n\n6. **Monitor Body Language**:\n   - Pay attention to both pets’ body language. A wagging tail in a dog can signify excitement or tension, while a cat’s raised fur or growling can indicate stress.\n   - If the situation becomes tense, separate the animals and give them a break.\n\n7. **Gradual Increase in Exposure**:\n   - As they become more comfortable with each other, allow them more freedom to interact without barriers. Continue to supervise these interactions until you are confident they are comfortable together.\n\n8. **Consult Professionals if Needed**:\n   - If you're having trouble with the introduction or if either pet shows signs of stress or aggression, consider seeking advice from a professional animal behaviorist.\n\nRemember, every animal is unique, and some introductions may take longer than others. Be patient and move at a pace that is comfortable for both the dog and the cat.",
